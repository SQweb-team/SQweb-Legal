Privacy Policy
===

Your privacy is critically important to us. At SQweb we have a few fundamental principles:

- We don't ask for personal information unless we truly need it ;
- We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services ;
- We don't share personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.

The gathering and processing of information operated by SQweb has been declared to the CNIL (N° 1877571).

##GATHERING OF NON PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

SQweb collects non-personally-identifying information (browser type ; language ; referring site ; date and time of each request). SQweb's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how its service is used, and to ensure it’s operating properly.

SQweb may compile global statistics about the behavior of the users of its service. From time to time, SQweb may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.

SQweb also collects potentially personally-identifying information (Internet Protocol addresses). SQweb handles this data like personal information.

##GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

Certain visitors to SQweb’s websites choose to interact with SQweb in ways that require SQweb to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SQweb gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide their full names and email address. Those who engage in transactions with SQweb – by purchasing a subscription to the service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.

SQweb collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's or user's interaction with SQweb. SQweb does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

##PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND FRAUD PREVENTION

SQweb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SQweb’s behalf or to provide services available at SQweb’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SQweb’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

SQweb will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SQweb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SQweb believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SQweb, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user to SQweb's service and have supplied your email address, SQweb may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SQweb and our products.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

SQweb takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

SQweb monitors the use of its service to detect suspicious or fraudulent activities, and may, if necessary disclose some information according to the terms described above, in order to avoid it or to sanction it.

##COOKIES

SQweb uses cookies to identify and track visitors, their usage of our website and service, and preferences, such as their preferred language of communication. SQweb visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SQweb’s websites. However, our service may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Websites using SQweb may display ads, delivered by their advertising partners, who may set cookies themselves. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SQweb and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, or any third parties.

##BUSINESS TRANSFERS

If SQweb, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SQweb goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SQweb may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

##PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES

This privacy policy may be updated to accomodate evolutions of the service. SQweb may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SQweb’s sole discretion.

If you have a SQweb account, you will be informed about these changes via your dashboard and via email. Your continued use of this site, and the service provided by SQweb, will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
