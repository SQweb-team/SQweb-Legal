Privacy Policy
===

**Your privacy is critically important to us : we only ask for personal information if it is required for the on-going operation of our services, and except for rare exceptions described thereafter, we never share it.**

In France, the gathering and processing of information operated by SQweb has been declared to the CNIL (N° 1877571).

##GATHERING OF NON PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

SQweb collects non-personally-identifying information (browser and device type ; language ; referring site ; timestamp of each request). SQweb's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how its service is used, and to ensure it is operating properly.

SQweb may compile global usage statistics about its service. SQweb may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends about the usage of its service.

SQweb handles Internet Protocol addresses used to access its services like personal information.

##GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

Certain visitors to SQweb’s websites choose to interact with SQweb in ways that require SQweb to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SQweb gathers depends on the nature of the relationship of the user with SQweb, whether the user is a subscriber or not, or a publisher.

Users who sign up are required to provide their full names and email address. Those who purchase a subscription to the service are asked to provide additional information required to process this transaction.

SQweb collects such information only insofar as is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's or user's interaction with SQweb. SQweb does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

##PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND FRAUD PREVENTION

SQweb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to its employees, contractors and authorized third parties that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SQweb’s behalf or to provide services available at SQweb’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and authorized third parties may be located outside of your home country; by using SQweb’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. A list of our authorized third parties is available in appendix.

**SQweb will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.** Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SQweb discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SQweb believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SQweb, third parties or the public at large.

If you are a registered user to SQweb's service and have supplied your email address, SQweb may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SQweb and our products.

If you send us a request, a critique or a suggestion, we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request, and more generally, to improve our service.

SQweb takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information against unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction.

SQweb closely monitors the use of its service to detect suspicious or fraudulent activities, and may, if necessary disclose some information according to the terms described above, in order to avoid it or to sanction it.

##COOKIES

Websites using SQweb may display ads to non-registered users, delivered by their advertising partners, who may set cookies themselves. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SQweb only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers, or any third parties.

SQweb uses cookies to identify users, to track their usage of our service and preferences, such as their preferred language of communication. SQweb visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SQweb’s websites. However, our service will not function properly without the aid of cookies.

##BUSINESS TRANSFERS

If SQweb, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SQweb goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SQweb may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

##PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES

This privacy policy may be updated to accomodate evolutions of the service. SQweb may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in SQweb’s sole discretion.

If you have a SQweb account, you will be informed about these changes via your dashboard and via email. Your continued use of this site, and the service provided by SQweb, will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
